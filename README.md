This repository contains solutions to a vending machine programming challenge detailed in [Problem details](https://github.com/Cairns/Optum/blob/main/Documents/Vending%20Machine%20Kata%20-%20Reduced%201.pdf)

It comprises of the following solutions
<br/>
[VendingMachine](https://github.com/Cairns/Optum/blob/main/VendingMachine/) which followed a TDD approach to the solution
<br/>
[VendingMachineEventDriven](https://github.com/Cairns/Optum/blob/main/VendingMachineEventDrivenAi/) which was built with the use of AI (Claude Sonnet 3.5) and makes use of an event driven solution.
<br/>
[VendingMachineStateMachine](https://github.com/Cairns/Optum/blob/main/VendingMachineStateMachineAi/) which was built with the use of AI (Claude Sonnet 3.5) and makes use of a state machine driven solution.
